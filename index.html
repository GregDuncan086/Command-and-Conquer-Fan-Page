        <h1>Welcome to Command & Conquer Fan Page</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Command & Conquer was released worldwide by Westwood in 1995. The plot is set sometime in the near future
            where the Earth becomes contaminated by a mysterious substance known as Tiberium. A global war ensues
            between the UN-formed Global Defense Initiative to contain it and the cult quasi-state revolutionary
            Brotherhood of Nod, led by the enigmatic Kane, which seeks to harness it. Highly successful, it was followed
            by Command & Conquer: Red Alert in 1996 which is set in an alternate universe where the Soviet Union wages
            war with the Allies. Developed as the prequel to the original, the Red Alert series was spun off into a
            separate, lighthearted and comic series, while the original game and its sequels became known as the
            "Tiberium" series, retaining its science fiction and serious tone. The first game is sometimes referred to
            as Tiberian Dawn as a result.

            The original game was followed by Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun in 1999 and its expansion pack Firestorm.
            In 2002, Westwood Studios released Command & Conquer: Renegade, a first-person shooter. Renegade was praised
            for its online features. A spin-off game in 2003, Command & Conquer: Generals, set in a more realistic
            near-future and featuring the United States, China and the Global Liberation Army was followed by an
            expansion pack, Zero Hour. Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars was released in 2007 and followed by the
            expansion pack Kane's Wrath. Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight, released in 2010 as the conclusion to
            the Tiberium saga, received mixed reviews because of its deviation from traditional gameplay and story. The
            Red Alert series was continued by the 2000 title Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2, its expansion, Yuri's
            Revenge and Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 in 2008, which introduced a third faction, the Empire of the
            Rising Sun, which resembles Japan with futuristic robotic technology.

            The series is primarily developed for personal computers running Microsoft Windows, although some titles
            have been ported to various video game consoles and Apple Macintosh. Other games for platforms such as iOS
            and web-based have also been developed. As of July 2010, the Command & Conquer franchise consists of eleven
            games and eight expansion packs. The first three games of the series have been released as freeware to
            promote the successors.[4] A free-to-play game, entitled Command & Conquer, was in development with the
            studio Victory Games. It was set to be the next game in the series and was expected to be released in 2013.
            However, after a short alpha period the game was cancelled, and Victory Games disbanded by EA.[5][6] The
            Command & Conquer series has been a commercial success with over 30 million Command & Conquer games sold as
            of 2009.
