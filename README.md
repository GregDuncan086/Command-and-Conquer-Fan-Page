### **Design Choices**

#### Fonts

In order to find the appropriate fonts for the webiste, I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to explore the various options. For the overall content I have decided to use [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) font. In my opinion this font is easy to read and visually appealing. 

For the headings in the website I have decdied to use [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) in order to make the headings stand out from the main content.

#### Icons

I have decided to implement icons, using the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) library. The icons that I chose are for the social media links and are self explanatory. The navigation menu will transform into a hamburger icon on a mobile device to make it more simple to use.

#### Colours

I have based my colour scheme for the site on the various colour schemes used in the Command and Conquer universe. I have used the site [Coolor](https://coolors.co/) to decide on my colour palette foe the site. You can view my colour scheme [here](wireframes/colour-palette.png). I will explain in more detail below why I chose the the various colours and what I will be using them for in the website.

![Colour Scheme](wireframes/colour-paletee.png)

- #0710136: This colour will be used as the background for the site. It is a black colour that is the background for most things in Command & Conquer.

- #446df6: This colour will be used for the timeline. It is the colour of the Allies faction in Command & Conquer Red Alert.

- #b40439: This colour will be used for the main text in the site. This is the colour of the Soviet faction in Command & Conquer Red Alert.

- #f5cb5c: This colour will be used for all the headings in the site. This is the colour of the GDI faction in the original Command & Conquer.

- #5b8e7d: This colour will be used for the social media icon link in the footer. This is the colour of the grassy terrain in the game.

I have chosen all of these colours to try and keep in theme with the main colour schemes in Command & Conquer.

#### Structure

I have chosen to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create the overall structure for my website. Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is helpful to keep a good strucutre on your page. As Bootstrap is designed for mobile first, I will be certain that my website functions well on a mobile device.

## **Wireframes**

I have decided to use [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create the wireframes for my website. I created wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. For my website I have decdied to do a one page website with three scrollable sections. Thye webiste will be easy to navigate using the navigation menu or by scrollig up and down the page.

You can find my wireframes for each decive below:

### [Desktop Wireframe](wireframes/desktop-wireframe.png)
### [Tablet Wireframe](wireframes/tablet-wireframe.png)
### [Mobile Wireframe](wireframes/mobile-wireframe.png)

## **Features**

### **Exsiting Features**

#### Navigation

For the navbar I have used Bootstrap to create a responsive navbar. I have implemented the hamburger icon for mobile devices to be more user-friendly.

#### Hero Image

I have decided to implement a hero image which spreads across 100% of the screen. In order to make the user curious as to what follows next and also to grab the users attention as soon as they visit the site.

#### Welcome Section

I have used the Bootstrap grid system here to create 3 columns on desktop view, which turn into full width on mobile devices.

#### Timeline Section

I have used code from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_timeline.asp) to form the base timeline and then altered the code to suit my need for this website.

#### Gallery

For the gallery section I have created a class which contains all the settings for psotioning of the images. The images will be displayed in a 3 x 3 grid on desktop and two columns of four images on mobile devices.

#### Contact

At the contact section I have provided a form to be filled out to raise any mistakes or inaccurate information contained in the website. The form consists of a first and second name input field, an email input field and a small text input field. Below this input fields there is a submit button. The form will also trigger a modal box to confirm sucessful submission of the form.

### **Features to be Implemeneted**

- Interavtive forum where players can share their eperiences of Command & Conquer games, as well as being able to arrange multiplayer games if they choose.
- A form that allows uers to sign up for a newsletter for any online events that the site may hold in the future.
- An clickable link otion that will take you to the sotre pages of Steam and Origin if the user wishes to quickly buy any of the Command & Conquer games.

He gave me the idea to do this page for this project as well as putting me at ease with any apprehensions that I had about doing this project. The tools and information that he has shared with me have really helped me in completing this project.

I also want to say a special thanks to [Sharon Luff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-luff-1a24b2175/) of [The Learning People](https://www.learningpeople.com/uk/) for helping me through some difficulty times lead up ot this project and for beliving that I could complete this.

I would also like to thank my parnter Emma for beliving in me and giving me honest feedback on the website.

I want to thak the Slack community as well. Whenever I had any problems with the building of this website, I did some research on Slack and always found someone who has had the same issue as i did and there was usually a solution to the problem. This really helped me with this project.

As one of of my main passions is gaming I was able to put myself in the shoes of a potential visitor to the site and a player of the Command & Conquer series.
